# Evigauge dev-log — Stop hook.
#
# When Claude finishes a task in a repo that has opted into the dev-log, this
# nudges Claude to enrich any commit entries the post-commit hook left as stubs
# (enriched: false) — filling the reasoning/logic and wiring the semantic graph
# edges. It blocks the stop with an instruction (Claude then runs the evigauge:log
# enrich flow), and gives up after 2 no-progress rounds so it can NEVER loop.
#
# Fail-open everywhere: any problem => allow the stop (exit 0). Telemetry about
# the build must never trap the developer's session.
